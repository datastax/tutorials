= Astra Tutorials documentation

This repo contains the source files for the Astra Tutorials documentation.

The docs are written in AsciiDoc and use Antora to generate the output.

The Astra Tutorials docs are organized with one Antora component, tutorials, currently.
That component has one module, ROOT.

== Dependencies

Antora requires NodeJS, install it and then install the project dependencies:

[source, shell, subs="attributes+"]
----
npm install
----

== Viewing the current HTML output

//The current development version of the docs are generated and published at https://stargate.github.io/docs/.

//The `.github/workflows/antora.yml` GitHub action will generate and publish the development docs on pushes to the master branch. Development docs use the `site-local.yaml` Antora site configuration file.

== Generating and viewing the HTML output locally

The docs can be generated locally during development, to check work. 

Use the `build-locally.sh` script with the appropriate docset to build:

[source, shell, subs="attributes+"]
----
./build-locally.sh tutorials
----

This build script will make sure you have the correct prerequisites installed for the antora build.

== Publishing to the Tutorials website

// clun - you'll want to change this
//Pushing a tag starting with `v` will trigger the `.github/workflows/publish.yaml` action that generates the docs and publishes them to the `stargate/website` repo in the `gh-pages` branch. The output will be put in the `docs` directory. Live docs use the `site-publish.yaml` Antora site configuration file.

//The Deploy to GitHub Pages action uses a repo secret in order to push the changes to stargate/website.
//To use a different secret:

//. https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line#creating-a-token[Create a personal access token].
//. https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets[Add it to stargate/docs as a repo secret].
//. Update the name of the secret in `publish.yaml`.
