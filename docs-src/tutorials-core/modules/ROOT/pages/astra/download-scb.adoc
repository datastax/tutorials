== A - Overview

To initialize a *secured* 2-way TLS connection between clients and Astra
x509 certificates are needed. The strong authentication is key for
maximum security and still benefits from robust driver features
(health-check, load-balancing, fail-over). Under the hood the protocol
SNI over TCP is used to contact each node independently.

The configuration and required certificates are provided to the user
through a zip file called the *secure connect bundle* which can be
downloaded for each *DATABASE REGION*. This means that a database
deployed across multiple regions will have one secure connect bundle per
region. _(1 region = 1 underlying Apache Cassandraâ„¢ datacenter)_

== B - Prerequisites

* You should have an http://astra.datastax.com/[Astra account]
* You should link:/astra-create-instance[Create and Astra Database]

== C - Procedure

*âœ… Step 1 : Select your database*

Once signed in Astra the list of available databases is located in the
menu on the left.

* Select the database that you want to work with.
* Click on the `CONNECT` tab or the big blue button `[CONNECT]` in the
upper right hand corner.

*âœ… Step 2 : Download the ZIP*

* On this screen look for *`Connect using a driver`*. You can pick any
of the folowing options; `Node.js` (`javascript`), `Python` or `Java`.
*It will be the same file download.*
* Click on `Download Bundle` and select the region that you want to use.
* Click on target region to copy the link locally.

=== Remarks

* Most browsers will give you the option to open the zip file directly.
_Do not do that, save it locally instead_: the bundle zipfile will be
passed to the drivers as is!
* The generated link to the bundle zipfile will expire a few minutes
after it is generated. If you wait too long on the ``Connect'' page, you
might end up with a faulty bundle. As a check, make sure the zipfile you
downloaded is around 12-13 KB in size.
