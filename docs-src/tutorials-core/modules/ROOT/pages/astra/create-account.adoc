=== 3. Multiple Organizations

You can create multiple organizations through the
*`Manage Organizations`* menu option and invite other users to join as
well. It is useful when the same database could be accessed by multiple
users with different emails.

As a consequence a user can be part of multiple organizations; the
personal organization created during registration, new user-defined
organizations, and shared organizations.
