== Where should I find a database identifier ?

The database `id` is a unique identifier (`GUID`) for your database. You
can find it on the main dashboard of AstraDB. You can copy it to the
clipboard by clicking the small icon üìã

_‚ÑπÔ∏è Note that, unlike the database identifier, the database name is not
unique in an organization. (`project` in the screenshot above)_

== Where should I find a database region name ?

A database can have one or multiple regions. Each region will have a
datacenter Id and a region name. The region name is the one used in the
Api Urls.

* Access your database dashboard by clicking its name either in the menu
on the left or on the main panel.

* Locate the region name in the Regions table. In the screenshot below
we do have two; `europe-west1` and `us-east1`.

== How do I create a namespace or a keyspace ?

Namespaces and keyspaces are synonyms. There are two ways to create
them.

* You can create them when you create a database

* You can create them on the Database Dashboard in the `Keyspaces`
section by clicking the button `Add Keyspace`.

_Access your database dashboard by clicking its name either in the menu
on the left or on the main panel._

_Locate the Add Keyspace button in the botton right-hand corner_

_Create Keyspace from its name. The database will switch to
`MAINTENANCE` mode for a few seconds but do not worry the application
can still request the other keyspaces._
